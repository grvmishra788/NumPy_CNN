# NumPy_CNN
A NumPy only implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network

### Objective 
Although modern ML frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras have eased the process of implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), being able to code a CNN from scratch highlights deeper understanding of how it works. The goal of this project is to implement a CNN using NumPy so as to highlight this basic understanding of essentials of a CNN.
